# My Diary 2 (Nav Drawer edition)

## About
This is an application to motivate a user to write down day-to-day diary entries.

## The user can:
- Create entries
- Read past entries
- Update any entry
- Delete entries
- Rename their diary to any name of their choosing

## Entries
There is only 1 entry allowed per day, so if the user clicks on 'create a new entry' by accident it will prompt them to the current day's one instead. They can create a new entry on the next day instead.

## Diary
This is supposed to be a personalized diary, so changing the name to whatever the user wants adds personality to the diary.
